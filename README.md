Driver drowsiness is a significant cause of traffic accidents, leading to serious consequences for both people and property. To enhance road safety, this study proposes a real-time drowsiness prediction system based on photoplethysmography (PPG) signals collected from the fingertip using a MAX30102 sensor and processed by an ESP32 microcontroller. The proposed system extracts features from the PPG signal across three domains: time, wavelet, and nonlinear. Time-domain features include heart rate (bpm), mean peak-to-peak interval, standard deviation of peak intervals, average amplitude, and average rise time from trough to peak. Wavelet-domain features consist of the kurtosis of detail coefficients at levels D1, D2, D3, and approximation coefficients at level A4. Nonlinear features include Average Mutual Information (AMI), False Nearest Neighbors (FNN), Lyapunov Exponent, Renyi Entropy, and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). All features are computed using a 60-second sliding window with a 1-second step. Each window is labeled as either “drowsy” (1) or “alert” (0). Three separate Random Forest models are trained to classify drowsiness based on the features extracted from each domain. The system is designed to operate in real time, providing early warnings to drivers upon detecting signs of drowsiness. This research contributes to the development of non-invasive driver state monitoring systems capable of enhancing road safety and reducing drowsiness-related accidents.
